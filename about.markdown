Hello! I'm Darren, an aspiring data analyst and all-round programming enthusiast. After working as a stage technician in London for some time, I've spent the past few years exploring the world of data and computer science.

In this blog, you'll find a feed full of my thoughts and future plans (many of which are how I plan to improve this blog). My goal is to share my thoughts, track my progress, and hopefully build a community of like-minded individuals.

When I'm not configuring NeoVim or writing code, you can find me watching football, spending time with friends and family, or (most likely) doomscrolling through YouTube shorts.

Feel free to reach out to me via [email!](mailto:darren.wilby10@gmail.com)
