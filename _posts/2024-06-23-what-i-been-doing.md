title: What I've been up to this week
---
In my attempt to not litter this blog with unnecessary posts, I have inadvertantly stopped posting entirely.

So instead, I will go back to more regular updates on what I'm working on. Maybe once a week.

This past week or so I have been doing a few different things:
- Reworking my Smart Home Project - it's still a bit coupled for my liking. I will also look into more monitoring capabilities. The hardest part comes from GCP having so many different things to use that it ends up creating decision fatigue.
- Starting a new project collecting and analysing FPL data.
- Lots of maths. Currently brushing up on integral calculus, I want to make sure I have a solid foundation before I move on to linear algebra. I want to study machine learning but I don't want to just jump into using packages like PyTorch and Tensorflow before I understand what's going on underneath.

This is not including the hours spent thinking about how I could do a far better job than Gareth Southgate.
