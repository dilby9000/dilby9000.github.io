I am still mulling over what I want the purpose of this site to be. My current vision includes:

- An 'About' page giving some info about me, what I have done, and what I want to accomplish.
- A 'Projects' page displaying (and linking to) some of the interesting projects I have built and the ones I am currently working on.
- A 'Home' page which will contain a feed of all of my blog posts. In these, I will describe what I have been doing on a day-to-day basis, the things I have learned, and whatever else I think is appropriate.
- Finally, an 'Articles' page, with a feed of articles I hope to write.

Today, I am working on job applications, finishing off differential calculus study, some small coding/scripting/algorithm problems, and this post!
