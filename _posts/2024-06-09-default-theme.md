After some deliberation (mostly time spent fighting Jekyll), I've decided to opt for the default theme. I considered using a much less bloated theme in terms of functionality and features but that won't be any time soon. I'm not a frontend guy, so long as it's functional and doesn't look awful I'm happy!

However, an optional dark mode is a non-negotiable for me. So I know what feature I'll be working on next!
